GitHub
git remote add origin git@joker-ksh  -> it will add the local git with name origin in remote GitHub
git remote -v    -> to check whether local git added to remote or not
By default the git branch name is master as it is older but in modern vcs it is named as main so we need to change it 
git branch -M main  -> branch name master to main

In remote vcs we should always check the pull request before push as it could be an existing repo so pull first 

git pull --rebase origin main --> rebase => as the repo could be committed by other's , origin => remote vcs name and main => brach 
git push -u origin main  ---> -u = > upstream set from local machine to remote vcs
