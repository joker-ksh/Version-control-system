git config --global user.name "<name>" -> to set global name
git config --global user.name    -> give the global name
git config --global user.email "<email>" -> to set email 
git config --global user.email   -> give the email set

git init -> initialize the .git in the correct directory

git add /<file path> -> to add the file for stagging state
git diff   -> show the changes in code files 
git add .  -> add all the files in git tracking
git rm /<file path>  -> to remove a file from git stagging state

git commit -m "msg"  -> commit the stagging state content of the git 

git log   -> all commits in detailed
git log --online -> commits in one line 
git status   -> stagging status of the git 

commits are in the form of linked list and the head points to the recent commit

git reset --hard <commit ID> -> delete all the commits above the current commit id permanently
git revert <commit ID>   -> just revert the commit with <commit id>





GitHub
git remote add origin git@joker-ksh  -> it will add the local git with name origin in remote GitHub
git remote -v    -> to check whether local git added to remote or not
By default the git branch name is master as it is older but in modern vcs it is named as main so we need to change it 
git branch -M main  -> branch name master to main

In remote vcs we should always check the pull request before push as it could be an existing repo so pull first 

git pull --rebase origin main --> rebase => as the repo could be committed by other's , origin => remote vcs name and main => brach 
git push -u origin main  ---> -u = > upstream set from local machine to remote vcs





Branching 
git branch  -> to check the current branch
git branch "new-branch" =>  to create a new branch
git checkout new-branch -> to switch to new branch

merging branches
git push --set-upstream origin piyush-feat  -> create a bew branch in origin server if the new branch not exists remotely	
first checkout to the main branch (in which you want to add the existing branch) => git checkout main
now merge the branch => git merge origin/piyush-feat (it will merge the branch locally)
now push this to the server -> git push
